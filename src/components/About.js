        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>
          During a Biofield Tuning session, a client lies fully clothed on a
          treatment table while the practitioner activates a tuning fork and
          scans the biofield slowly, beginning from about six feet away.
          Biofield Tuning sessions can also be conducted from a distance.
        </p>
        <p>The practitioner:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>feels for resistance and turbulence in the client's biofield</li>
          <li>
            listens for a change in the overtones and undertones of the tuning
            fork
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When the practitioner encounters a turbulent area she continues to
          activate the tuning fork and hold it in that specific spot. Research
          suggests the body's organizing intelligence uses the steady coherent
          vibrational frequency of the tuning fork to "tune" itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short order, the dissonance resolves and the sense of resistance
          gives way. This appears to correspond to the release of tension with
          the body. People relax and breathe more freely and the body enters
          into an increased flow state.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the biofield dissonance subsides, clients generally report feeling
          "lighter," able to breathe more freely, and a diminishment or
          resolution of their symptoms.
        </p>
        <h2>What does Biofield Tuning treat?</h2>
        <p>
          Biofield Tuning treatment centers, balances and integrates our energy
          resetting the nervous system into a more relaxed place, resulting in
          immediate and sometimes profound relief from pain, tension and
          anxiety. Also, the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adhesions</li>
          <li>Headaches</li>
          <li>Migraines</li>
          <li>Pelvic Pain</li>
          <li>Insomnia</li>
          <li>Emotional Trauma</li>
          <li>Neck &amp; Back Pain</li>
          <li>Depression</li>
          <li>Painful Scars</li>
          <li>Stress</li>
          <li>Fear</li>
          <li>Anxiety</li>
          <li>Digestive Issues</li>
          <li>Feeling "Stuck"</li>
          <li>Low Energy</li>
          <li>Acute Pain</li>
          <li>Muscle Pain</li>
          <li>Addictions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The term biofield refers to our body's electrical system in its
          entirety - both the electric current that runs through our bodies, and
          the magnetic field that surrounds it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biofield Tuning is a sound therapy method that works directly with
          this system, seeing it as inextricably connected with our conscious
          and subconscious mind, including our memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          All physical, mental and emotional disorders can be perceived as
          "dissonance" in our electrical system. Biofield Tuning is able to
          locate, diminish, and resolve this dissonance and in doing so,
          alleviate and even eradicate the corresponding physical, mental and/or
          emotional symptoms.
