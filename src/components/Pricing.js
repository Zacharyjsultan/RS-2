            It was calming, soothing, relaxing, restorative, and provoked
            positive thoughts and memories. I felt it eased my anxiety and
            stress. As a music specialist, I was able to recognize specific
            sounds and pitch which decreased my apprehension and brought me
            peaceful moments. -Rosie

            My interest in Biofield tuning began when I heard it helps to boost
            your immune system. I had been struggling with sinus infections and
            thought I should give it a try. The beginning of the session felt
            like a meditation session. The sounds during the sessions were
            effective in helping me to relax. Many times during the session the
            energy in my body was shifting. Rebecca was walking me through
            different questions where she sensed resistance in my energy. The
            experience was shocking because she touched on significant points in
            my life without any input from me. This made me feel like she was
            very intune with my energy. The session itself was very relaxing.
            The next day was very emotional for me. I had two crying spells
            throughout the day and felt like I was heavy with emotion. I was
            able to process my feeling with my Husband and expressed many
            emotions during a major crying spell. I felt so much better after
            that and the following day I felt so light and as if a weight had
            been lifted off. Rebecca did mention that an emotional release would
            happen, but I was surprised at the extent of which it did. It&#39;s
            been a few months since my session and I still feel great and
            emotionally in a better place. -B
